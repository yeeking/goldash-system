how to build:

Clone the Markov model repo into the Source folder:

```
cd Source
git clone https://github.com/yeeking/MarkovModelCPP.git
```

Load the .jucer file into projucer

Export your project (xcode, Visual Studio etc.)

Build the standalone app and/ or the VST plugin

The plugin should auto install in the correct place on your system so your DAW should find it on next launch.
